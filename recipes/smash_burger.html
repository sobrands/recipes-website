        <h1>Ultra Smashed Cheeseburger</h1>
        <img src="../img/smash_burger.jpg" alt="juicy smashed cheeseburger">
        <p>I'm on my journey to find the best cheeseburger in Singapore, but most of them are too expensive</p>
        <p>So I thought, why not make my own?</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
            <li>Condiments (e.g. Lettuce, Tomatoes, Mayonnaise)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice of good melting cheese, such as American, Cheddar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These burgers cook very fast, so it's best to make them one at a time. If making multiple burgers, keep them warm under a tent of foil while preparing subsequent burgers.</p>
